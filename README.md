## Testing

+ Passed the code trough a PEP8 linter for the 100% Clear

+ Given invalid inputs are not going trough as the validator`s work

+ Heroku's mock terminal start and finishes the game as intended


## Deployment
Files are deployed to Git hub :https://github.com/hugoht3/battle-ship

Also deployed to Heroku for use the use of Mock terminal,
provided by CODE INSTITUTE :https://xxbattle-shipxx-618349b2d0ae.herokuapp.com/

> Steps:

+ Clone the Repository: https://github.com/Code-Institute-Org/p3-template

+ Created a Heroku, Set the buildbacks to Python and NodeJS in that particular order 

+ Link the Git Hub repository to Heroku

+ Clicked deploy

### Redeployment 
    Improve code readebility

# Corrected some user inputs :
    Where as the player could before make the same move twice.
    The same as for the computer guess

# Board 
    Made the board stop showing the enemy ships
